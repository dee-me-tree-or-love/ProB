		<p>Most bananas exported to Europe are grown on large-scale 
		plantations in Latin America, and increasingly, in Africa. 
		Banana plantations are monocultures - where only one type of 
		crop is grown. 97% of internationally traded bananas come from 
		one single variety, the Cavendish. This lack of genetic variety
		makes plants highly susceptible to pests, fungi and diseases and 
		therefore large quantities of insecticides and other pesticides are 
		applied to the crops.
		</p>
		<p>
		As the pests and diseases adapt, ever stronger, more harmful 
		pesticides need to be applied. In several countries plantation 
		owners spend more money on agrochemicals than on their workforce. 
		Fertilisers and pesticides pollute water channels resulting in fish 
		kills and the destruction of other aquatic life including coral reefs. 
		Carelessly stored chemicals seep into the soil and water courses.

			<h3>Key environmental problems include:</h3> 
			<li>contamination of water courses </li>
			<li>massive levels of waste </li>
			<li>soil erosion</li>
			<li>increased risk of flooding</li>
			<li>deforestation and destruction of habitats</li>
			<li>destruction of soil fertility resulting in high fertiliser use.</li>

				<li><h4>Working conditions:</h4></li>
				<p>
				Pressure along the supply chain to keep prices low is primarily 
				felt by the hundreds of thousands of workers who toil long hours 
				in tropical conditions to look after and harvest the bananas we 
				consume. They often fail to earn enough to feed their families properly. 
				</p>
				<p>
				As has happened throughout our global economy, a significant proportion 
				of plantation labour has been outsourced to sub-contractors with companies 
				keen to distance themselves from any responsibility for employment 
				conditions and reduce costs. It is also much harder for sub-contracted 
				workers to organise into trade unions.
				</p>
				<li><h4>Health and Safety:</h4></li>			
				<p>
				The health and safety of workers is compromised by routine exposure to toxic agrochemicals and a lack of appropriate safety equipment. Field work is very physically demanding, especially in tropical conditions. In packhouses repetitive actions cause strains and injuries. Robust independent trade unions are vital to educate workers about health and safety at work and ensure that national legislation as well as private standards are observed.
				</p>
				<li><h4>Trade union freedom:</h4></li>
				<p>Trade union membership is low in some exporting countries due to the 
				widespread use of a range of anti-union tactics by national and 
				multinational banana companies. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In Guatemala banana workers face 
				some of the worst conditions and trade union activists face violence 
				and even assassination. In Costa Rica the banana companies use non-union 
				committees and the 'Solidarismo' movement to prevent independent trade unions from forming or from gaining members. These committees sign so-called 'settlements' covering wages and conditons that the industry presents to the outside world as collective bargaining, but in which the workers have had no real say.

				These diagrams illustrate how the value from the sale of bananas can be distributed along the supply chain.

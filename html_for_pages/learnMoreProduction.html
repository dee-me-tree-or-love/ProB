		The banana is a perennial plant that replaces itself. 
		Bananas do not grow from a seed but from a bulb or rhizome. 
		The time between planting a banana plant and the harvest of the banana bunch 
		is from 9 to 12 months. The flower appears in the sixth or 
		seventh month. Bananas are available throughout the year - 
		they do not have a growing 'season'.
		</p>
		<p>
		Bananas are grown in tropical regions. They require moist soil with 
		good drainage. In fact, most bananas exported are grown within 30 
		degrees either side of the equator
		</p>
		<p>
		Plantations are predominant in Latin America and they require huge investment in 
		infrastructure and technology for transport, 
		irrigation, drainage and packing facilities.

		<h1>Harvesting and ripening</h1>

		<p>
		After nine months, the bananas are harvested while still green.
		At the packhouse they are inspected and sorted for export. 
		Buyers of fruit in the UK want unbruised bananas and so very high 
		standards are set. If 
		the bananas do not meet these standards they are usually sold locally 
		at a much lower price.
		</p>
		<p>
		They are then transported to ports to be packed in refrigerated 
		ships called reefers (bananas take between six and twelve days to 
		get to the UK/Europe).
		</p>
		<p>
		Humidity, ventilation and temperature conditions are carefully 
		monitored in order to maintain quality. <br/>When the bananas arrive 
		at their destination port they are first sent to ripening rooms 
		(aprocess involving ethylene gas) and then sent to the shops. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Dessert banana production for export (around 15 million tonnes per year) 
		is of huge economic importance for many countries in the South. It relies on 
		intensive monocultures, which are sustained by using massive quantities of 
		toxic chemicals which are hazardous to both workers and the environment. This 
		industrial-scale production also results in problematic waste management issues.

			<h1>Where Bananas are grown</h1>
		<p>
		Bananas are grown in countries of the tropics - Africa, 
		Latin America, Caribbean, Pacific etc. Many countries produce 
		bananas as a staple food and only around 20% of all bananas that 
		are produced are actually exported. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Most bananas sold on the British market are exported from Latin 
		America, and increasingly West Africa, as companies relocate in 
		search of ever 'cheaper' fruit, pursuing a 'Race to the Bottom' 
		in terms of social and environmental standards
		</p>

		Humidity, ventilation and temperature conditions are carefully 
		monitored in order to maintain quality. <br/>When the bananas arrive 
		at their destination port they are first sent to ripening rooms 
		(aprocess involving ethylene gas) and then sent to the shops.

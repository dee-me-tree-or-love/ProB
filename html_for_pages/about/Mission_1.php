<li>Small-scale and family farmers make a decent living from selling to international banana markets.</li>
<li>Consumers can buy good quality bananas and understand the need for pricing that will guarantee decent livelihoods for producers and workers.</li>
<li>The negative impacts of banana production on the natural environment are understood and addressed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<h4> Our values:</h4>
<li>Impartiality and rigour in the collection and analysis of information and evidence.</li>
<li>Openness and inclusivity towards all players in the chain who seek equitable and sustainable solutions.</li>

	<p> Project Banana is a not-for-profit co-operative based in Eindhoven, which works for fair and sustainable banana trades. We raise awareness of the poor living and working conditions faced by plantation workers and small producers all over the world.

	<p> Your support can help us to make some impact. Buying tropical fruit is often the closest relationship any of us have with the developing world. The consumer choices we make can - and do - have a direct impact on how people are employed and paid, and how their environment is treated.

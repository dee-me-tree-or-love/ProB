			Bananas are the most popular fruit in the world. The banana is, 
			in fact, not a tree but a high herb that grows up to 15 metres. 
			It is believed that there are almost 1000 varieties of bananas in 
			the world, subdivided in 50 groups. The most commonly known banana 
			is the Cavendish variety, which is the one produced for export markets.
			</p>
		
			<p>
			Bananas are grown in more than 150 countries, 
			producing 105 million tonnes of fruit per year. 
			Dessert bananas account for 43 million tonnes per year and are of 
			huge economic importance for many countries in the South.

			<p>
			It is believed that the earliest written reference to banana 
			is in Sanskrit and dates back to around 500 BC. Their origin is 
			placed in Southeast Asia, in the jungles of Malaysia, Indonesia or 
			Philippines, where many varieties of wild bananas still grow today. 
			They started to be traded internationally by the end of fourteenth century. 
			The development of railroads and technological advances in refrigerated 
			maritime transport subsequently enabled bananas to become the most important 
			world traded fruit.
